### 4.5. Database Encryption: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)

Given the sensitive nature of the data, Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) will be implemented at the database level for PostgreSQL.

#### 4.5.1. Implementation Details

*   **Technology:** PostgreSQL's built-in encryption features, or extensions like `pgcrypto`, will be used to implement TDE. The specific method will be determined based on performance testing and key management requirements.
*   **Scope:** All tables containing sensitive data (Users, Conversations, and Messages) will be encrypted. The Resources table, containing primarily public information, may be excluded from encryption to minimize performance overhead, but this will be re-evaluated based on a risk assessment.
*   **Key Management:** A robust key management system will be implemented to securely store and manage the encryption keys. This may involve using a Hardware Security Module (HSM) or a cloud-based key management service (e.g., AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud KMS). Key rotation policies will be established and enforced.
*   **Encryption at Rest:** TDE ensures that data is encrypted when stored on disk. This protects against unauthorized access to the physical storage media.
*   **Encryption in Transit:** While TDE addresses encryption at rest, encryption in transit (e.g., using TLS/SSL for connections to the database) is also crucial and will be maintained as a separate security measure.

#### 4.5.2. Implications

*   **Performance:** TDE can introduce performance overhead due to the encryption and decryption operations. This overhead will be carefully monitored and optimized through performance testing and database tuning. Strategies to mitigate performance impact include:
    *   Using hardware acceleration for encryption (if available).
    *   Optimizing database queries and indexing.
    *   Monitoring CPU utilization and I/O performance.
*   **Cost:** Implementing TDE can incur costs related to:
    *   Software licenses (if using commercial encryption solutions).
    *   Hardware (e.g., HSM).
    *   Cloud-based key management services.
    *   Performance optimization efforts.
*   **Complexity:** TDE adds complexity to database administration and operations. This includes:
    *   Key management.
    *   Backup and recovery procedures.
    *   Auditing and compliance.
    *   Database upgrades.
    *   Ensuring application compatibility with encryption.

#### 4.5.3. Alternatives Considered

*   **Application-Level Encryption:** While application-level encryption offers more control over encryption keys, it can be more complex to implement and manage. TDE was chosen for its relative ease of implementation and management at the database level.
*   **Column-Level Encryption:** Encrypting specific columns instead of the entire database could reduce performance overhead. However, this approach can be more complex to manage and may not provide sufficient protection against unauthorized access.

#### 4.5.4. Mitigation Strategies

To address the potential performance and complexity implications of TDE, the following mitigation strategies will be implemented:

*   **Performance Testing:** Thorough performance testing will be conducted to measure the impact of TDE on database performance.
*   **Database Tuning:** Database parameters will be tuned to optimize performance with TDE enabled.
*   **Key Management Automation:** Key management processes will be automated to reduce administrative overhead.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Comprehensive monitoring and alerting will be implemented to detect and respond to any performance or security issues.
*   **Regular Audits:** Regular security audits will be conducted to ensure the effectiveness of the encryption implementation.

#### 4.5.5. Conclusion

Implementing TDE is a crucial step in protecting the sensitive mental health data stored in the chatbot database. While there are potential implications for performance, cost, and complexity, these can be mitigated through careful planning, implementation, and ongoing monitoring. The benefits of enhanced data security and privacy outweigh the risks.

## 5. API Specifications

The chatbot will expose a RESTful API for communication between the frontend and backend. API endpoints will be secured using JWT authentication.

### General Error Handling

All API endpoints will return standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. In case of an error, the response body will contain a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Error message describing the issue."
  }
}
```

Common error codes include:

*   `AUTH_FAILED`: Authentication failed (invalid credentials, missing token).
*   `VALIDATION_ERROR`: Request body validation failed.
*   `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`: The requested resource was not found.
*   `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`: An unexpected error occurred on the server.
*   `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`: The rate limit for the endpoint has been exceeded.
*   `EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS`: The email is already registered.
*   `INVALID_TOKEN`: The provided token is invalid or expired.

### Rate Limiting

API endpoints will be rate-limited to prevent abuse and ensure availability. The following headers will be included in API responses to indicate the current rate limit status:

*   `X-RateLimit-Limit`: The maximum number of requests allowed within the rate limit window.
*   `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.
*   `X-RateLimit-Reset`: The time at which the rate limit window will reset (in UTC seconds since epoch).

## 6. Security Considerations

This section outlines the security measures implemented to protect user data and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the mental health support chatbot.

*   **Authentication and Authorization:** All API endpoints will be protected using JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. Strong authorization mechanisms will be implemented to ensure users only have access to the resources they are permitted to access.

*   **Password Policy:** To ensure strong passwords, the following policy will be enforced:
    *   **Minimum Length:** Passwords must be at least 12 characters long.
    *   **Character Requirements:** Passwords must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*).
    *   **Password Expiration:** Users will be required to change their passwords every 90 days.
    *   **Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** MFA will be mandatory for all users to provide an additional layer of security. Options for MFA will include authenticator apps (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy) and SMS-based verification (with consideration for security vulnerabilities associated with SMS).

*   **Rate Limiting:** To prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks, rate limiting will be implemented for all API endpoints.
    *   Specific rate limits will be determined based on the expected usage patterns of each endpoint.
    *   Rate limits will be documented in the API documentation, including the number of requests allowed per time window and the actions taken when the limit is exceeded (e.g., HTTP 429 Too Many Requests error).
    *   Rate limiting will be applied at multiple layers, including the application layer and the infrastructure layer (e.g., using a Web Application Firewall).

*   **Input Sanitization:** Robust input sanitization will be implemented to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
    *   All user inputs, including those processed by the NLP engine, will be carefully validated and sanitized.
    *   For the NLP engine, a security-focused library (e.g., OWASP Java Encoder, DOMPurify for JavaScript) will be used to sanitize input and prevent injection attacks.
    *   Input validation will include checks for data type, format, length, and allowed characters.
    *   Any invalid or potentially malicious input will be rejected or sanitized before being processed.

*   **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data will be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS with TLS 1.3 or higher) and at rest (using AES-256 encryption). Encryption keys will be securely managed and rotated regularly.

*   **Regular Penetration Testing:** To identify and address potential vulnerabilities, regular penetration testing will be conducted by external security experts.
    *   Penetration tests will be performed at least annually, and more frequently if significant changes are made to the system.
    *   Penetration tests will cover all aspects of the system, including the web application, API endpoints, and infrastructure.
    *   Findings from penetration tests will be documented and remediated in a timely manner.

*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Automated vulnerability scanning will be performed regularly on all components of the system, including the operating system, web server, application framework, and third-party libraries.
    *   Vulnerability scans will be performed at least weekly, and more frequently if new vulnerabilities are discovered.
    *   Vulnerability scan results will be reviewed and prioritized based on the severity of the vulnerability and the potential impact on the system.
    *   Vulnerabilities will be patched or mitigated in a timely manner.

*   **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** DLP measures will be implemented to prevent sensitive data from being accidentally or intentionally leaked.
    *   DLP measures will include data classification, data masking, and data monitoring.
    *   Policies will be established to control the access and use of sensitive data.
    *   Alerts will be generated when sensitive data is detected in unauthorized locations or being transmitted in an insecure manner.

*   **Regular Security Audits:** Regular security audits will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the security controls and identify areas for improvement.

*   **Output Encoding:** Output encoding will be used to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. All user-generated content will be properly encoded before being displayed to other users.

*   **Incident Response Plan:** A comprehensive incident response plan will be developed and documented to ensure that security incidents are handled effectively.
    *   The incident response plan will include procedures for identifying, containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents.
    *   The incident response plan will be tested regularly through tabletop exercises and simulations.
    *   The incident response plan will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently if significant changes are made to the system or the threat landscape.
    *   The plan will define roles and responsibilities for incident response team members.
    *   The plan will include communication protocols for notifying stakeholders of security incidents.

*   **Data Privacy:** All data will be handled in accordance with applicable data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). User consent will be obtained before collecting or processing any personal data. Data will be stored securely and only retained for as long as necessary.

This Security Considerations section will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect the evolving threat landscape and best practices in security.
