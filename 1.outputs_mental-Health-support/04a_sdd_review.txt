## SDD Review Report with Suggestions

**Overall Assessment:**
The SDD provides a good overview of the system architecture and components. However, there are some areas that need improvement, particularly in security and API specifications.

**Specific Suggestions:**

1.  **Security Considerations:**
    *   **Password Policy:** The SDD should explicitly define a strong password policy, including minimum length, character requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and password expiration. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be mandatory rather than optional.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting for all API endpoints to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. This should be documented in the Security Considerations section.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Enhance input sanitization, especially for the NLP engine. Implement robust validation and sanitization techniques to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities arising from malicious user input. Consider using a security-focused NLP library or service.
    *   **Regular Penetration Testing:** Include regular penetration testing by external security experts in addition to internal security audits.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement automated vulnerability scanning of all components and dependencies.
    *   **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** Implement DLP measures to prevent sensitive data from being leaked or exfiltrated.
    *   **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and document an incident response plan to handle security breaches and other security incidents.

2.  **API Specifications:**
    *   **Error Handling:** The API specifications should include detailed error handling information, including possible error codes and messages.
    *   **Request Validation:** Explicitly define request validation rules for each API endpoint.
    *   **Rate Limiting Headers:** Include rate limiting headers in API responses to inform clients about the current rate limit status.

3.  **Database Schema:**
    *   **Considerations for sensitive data:** Given the sensitive nature of mental health data, consider additional encryption at the database level, such as Transparent Data Encryption (TDE).

4. **Monitoring and Logging:**
    *   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate with a SIEM system for centralized security monitoring and analysis.

5. **General:**
    *   **Compliance:** Explicitly state compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA if applicable).

**Revised SDD Section 6 (Security Considerations - Example):**

## 6. Security Considerations

*   All API endpoints will be protected using JWT authentication.
*   User passwords will be hashed using a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
    *   **Password Policy:** Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords will expire every 90 days. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory.
*   Sensitive data will be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest (using AES-256 encryption).
*   Regular security audits and penetration testing will be conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   Input validation will be implemented to prevent injection attacks. Robust validation and sanitization techniques will be applied to all user inputs, especially those processed by the NLP engine.
*   Output encoding will be used to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Rate limiting will be implemented for all API endpoints to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The API will limit requests to 100 requests per minute per user.
