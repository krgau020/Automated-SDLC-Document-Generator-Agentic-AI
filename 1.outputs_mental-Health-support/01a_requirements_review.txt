# Mental Health Chatbot: Requirements Document - Technical Review Report

## 1. Introduction

This report presents a technical review of the Mental Health Chatbot Requirements Document, focusing on technical clarity, feasibility, logical structure, testability, and completeness. The review incorporates insights from the Business Analyst's analysis, a detailed mapping of User Stories to Functional Requirements, and a comprehensive risk assessment.

## 2. Overall Assessment

The requirements document provides a good foundation for developing a mental health chatbot. The functional requirements are generally well-defined and cover the core functionality outlined in the original client statement and the Business Analyst's analysis. However, there are areas where the requirements could be more specific, more testable, and more comprehensive to ensure a successful and ethical implementation.

## 3. Specific Findings and Recommendations

### 3.1. User Authentication and Authorization

*   **FR.1.1 - FR.1.6:** The requirements for user authentication and authorization are adequate.
    *   **Recommendation:** Consider adding multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an optional security enhancement (FR.1.4) to further protect user accounts.

### 3.2. Core Chatbot Functionality

*   **FR.2.1:** The chatbot shall be able to understand and respond to user input in natural language.
    *   **Recommendation:** This requirement is too broad. Specify the expected level of accuracy and the types of natural language the chatbot should be able to handle. Define metrics for evaluating the chatbot's natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities (TECH-1).
*   **FR.2.2:** The chatbot shall provide information and resources related to anxiety and stress management techniques (e.g., deep breathing exercises, mindfulness meditation).
    *   **Recommendation:** Specify the sources of information and resources (e.g., NIMH, WHO) and the process for ensuring the accuracy and currency of the information (FR.3.3, ETH-1).
*   **FR.2.3:** The chatbot shall be able to guide users through interactive exercises designed to reduce anxiety and stress.
    *   **Recommendation:** Define the types of interactive exercises and the criteria for selecting and implementing them. Consider incorporating gamification elements to enhance user engagement.
*   **FR.2.4:** The chatbot shall be able to identify keywords and phrases indicative of a mental health crisis (e.g., suicidal ideation, self-harm).
    *   **Recommendation:** This is a critical requirement. Specify the NLP techniques to be used, the accuracy required, and the escalation protocol in case of a detected crisis (FR.2.5, ETH-1). Implement regular testing and validation of the crisis detection functionality.
*   **FR.2.5:** Upon detection of a crisis, the chatbot shall provide immediate support and resources, including contact information for crisis hotlines and mental health professionals.
    *   **Recommendation:** Define the specific resources to be provided and the criteria for selecting them. Ensure the contact information is up-to-date and accurate. Provide a clear and easy way for users to access crisis support (DATA-1, ETH-1).
*   **FR.2.6:** The chatbot shall maintain a conversation history for each user, allowing them to review previous interactions.
    *   **Recommendation:** Specify the storage duration for conversation history and the security measures to protect this data (DATA-2, SEC-2). Provide users with options to delete their conversation history.
*   **FR.2.7:** The chatbot shall allow users to provide feedback on the quality of its responses and the helpfulness of its resources.
    *   **Recommendation:** Define the feedback mechanism and the process for analyzing and acting on user feedback (TECH-1, ETH-2).
*   **FR.2.9:** The chatbot should support multiple languages (initially English and Spanish).
    *   **Recommendation:** Define the process for translating content and ensuring cultural sensitivity.

### 3.3. Content and Resources

*   **FR.3.1 - FR.3.5:** The requirements for content and resources are generally adequate.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement a content review and approval workflow to ensure the accuracy and quality of information (FR.7.4, ETH-1). Regularly update the content library to reflect the latest research and best practices in mental health.

### 3.4. Personalization and Customization

*   **FR.4.1 - FR.4.4:** The requirements for personalization and customization are adequate.
    *   **Recommendation:** Ensure that personalization is implemented in a way that is transparent and explainable to users (ETH-2). Provide users with control over their personalization settings.

### 3.5. Integration and External Services

*   **FR.5.1 - FR.5.2:** These are marked as future enhancements and require careful consideration.
    *   **Recommendation:** Before implementing these features, conduct a thorough risk assessment, particularly focusing on data privacy, security, and ethical considerations (DATA-1, DATA-2, ETH-1). Ensure compliance with all applicable regulations.

### 3.6. Reporting and Analytics

*   **FR.6.1 - FR.6.4:** The requirements for reporting and analytics are adequate.
    *   **Recommendation:** Ensure that all data collection and analysis is conducted in accordance with relevant data privacy regulations and ethical guidelines (DATA-2, ETH-3). Provide users with clear and transparent information about data collection practices.

### 3.7. Security and Privacy

*   **FR.7.1 - FR.7.5:** The requirements for security and privacy are critical and require careful implementation.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement robust security measures to protect user data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure (SEC-1, SEC-2, SEC-3). Comply with all applicable data privacy regulations, including GDPR and CCPA. Provide users with clear and transparent information about data privacy practices. Obtain explicit user consent before collecting or using their personal data.

## 4. Missing Functional Requirements

Based on the Business Analyst's analysis, the following functional requirements are missing or need more emphasis:

*   **Proactive Support:** The chatbot should proactively offer support to users based on their mood, anxiety level, and past interactions.
    *   **Recommendation:** Add a functional requirement for proactive support, specifying the criteria for triggering proactive interventions and the types of support to be offered.
*   **Goal Setting and Progress Tracking:** The chatbot should allow users to set goals for their mental health and track their progress over time.
    *   **Recommendation:** Add functional requirements for goal setting and progress tracking, specifying the types of goals users can set, the metrics to be tracked, and the visualizations to be provided.
*   **Integration with Wearable Devices:** The chatbot should integrate with wearable devices to automatically track physiological data related to mood (e.g., heart rate, sleep patterns).
    *   **Recommendation:** Add a functional requirement for integration with wearable devices, specifying the types of data to be collected and the security and privacy measures to be implemented.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

The non-functional requirements outlined in the Business Analyst's analysis (Performance, Scalability, Security, Availability, Usability, Maintainability, Accessibility) should be explicitly included in the requirements document and defined with specific metrics and acceptance criteria.

## 6. Risk Mitigation

The risk assessment table provides a comprehensive overview of potential risks and mitigation strategies. It is essential to continuously monitor and evaluate the chatbot's performance, security, and ethical implications throughout its development and deployment. Regular risk assessments and updates to the mitigation strategies are crucial to ensure the chatbot is safe, effective, and ethical.

## 7. Conclusion

By addressing the recommendations outlined in this report, the Mental Health Chatbot Requirements Document can be further strengthened to ensure the successful development of a valuable and ethical tool for supporting the mental health of young adults.
