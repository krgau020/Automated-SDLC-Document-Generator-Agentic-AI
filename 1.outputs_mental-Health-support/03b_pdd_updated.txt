# Project Design Document: Mental Health Support Chatbot

**Version:** 1.2
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Status:** Final

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for a mental health support chatbot aimed at young adults (18-30) dealing with anxiety and stress. The chatbot will provide 24/7 support and resources. This document incorporates feedback from the Final Reviewer and builds upon the User Story, System Design Document (SDD), and UX considerations.

**User Story:** As a young adult user, I want to be able to create a secure account, log in, and manage my password, so that I can access personalized mental health support and resources while ensuring my data is protected.

**1.1 Purpose:** This Project Design Document (PDD) serves to detail the design specifications for the Mental Health Support Chatbot. It aims to provide a comprehensive blueprint for development, facilitate stakeholder review, and secure approval for the subsequent development phases.

**1.2 Scope:** This document covers the design of the chatbot's core functionalities, including user account management (creation, login, password reset, deletion), conversational interaction, access to a resource library, and personalized recommendations. Excluded from the scope are integrations with external mental health services for direct referrals (to be considered in future phases).

**1.3 Target Audience:** This document is intended for project managers, software developers, system architects, business analysts, and security personnel involved in the development and deployment of the Mental Health Support Chatbot.

## 2. Goals

*   Reduce the average response time to user inquiries to under 5 minutes within the first 3 months of launch.

*   Must contain at least one uppercase letter
*   Must contain at least one lowercase letter
*   Must contain at least one number
*   Must contain at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*)

A password strength meter will be implemented to provide users with real-time feedback on the strength of their password.

## 9. Security Best Practices

The application will adhere to OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) guidelines to ensure security. This includes:

*   **Input validation:** All user input will be validated to prevent injection attacks.
*   **Output encoding:** All output will be encoded to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **Authentication and authorization:** Strong authentication and authorization mechanisms will be implemented to protect user data.
*   **Regular security audits:** Regular security audits will be conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Encryption:** Sensitive data will be encrypted both in transit and at rest.  HTTPS will be enforced for all communication.

## 10. Session Management

Session management will be implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

*   **Session duration:** Sessions will expire after 30 minutes of inactivity.
*   **Session invalidation:** Sessions can be invalidated by the user (e.g., by logging out) or by the system (e.g., due to inactivity or security reasons).
*   **Storage:** JWTs will be stored in HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks.

## 11. Data Retention Policy

User data will be retained for as long as the user has an active account. Upon account deletion, user data will be anonymized or deleted within 30 days, in accordance with GDPR and CCPA regulations.  Certain data, such as aggregated and anonymized usage statistics, may be retained for longer periods for analytical purposes.

## 12. Compliance

The application will comply with the following regulations:

*   **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):**  The application will comply with GDPR requirements for data privacy and security, including obtaining user consent for data collection, providing users with access to their data, and allowing users to delete their data.
*   **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act):** The application will comply with CCPA requirements for data privacy and security for California residents, including providing users with the right to know what personal information is collected about them, the right to delete their personal information, and the right to opt-out of the sale of their personal information.
*   **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act):** While the chatbot is not intended to provide medical advice or treatment, we will implement safeguards to protect the privacy and security of any health-related information that users may share.

## 13. Monitoring and Logging

Comprehensive monitoring and logging mechanisms will be implemented to track user activity and identify potential security issues.

*   **User activity logging:** All user activity, including logins, logouts, password resets, and chatbot interactions, will be logged.
*   **Error logging:** All errors will be logged, including the error message, timestamp, and user ID (if available).
*   **Security event logging:** Security events, such as failed login attempts and suspicious activity, will be logged.
*   **Monitoring dashboards:** Monitoring dashboards will be created to visualize key metrics, such as user activity, error rates, and security events.
*   **Alerting:** Alerts will be configured to notify administrators of critical events, such as security breaches and system outages.
*   **Log Retention:** Logs will be retained for a period of 12 months.

## 14. Data Design

*   **14.1 Data Model:** The chatbot system will utilize a relational database (PostgreSQL) to store user data, resource metadata, and conversation history. Key entities include Users, Resources, Conversations, and Messages.
*   **14.2 Data Storage:** User data will be stored in encrypted format within the PostgreSQL database. Resource files (e.g., articles, videos) will be stored in a secure cloud storage service (e.g., AWS S3) with appropriate access controls.
*   **14.3 Data Security:** Data at rest will be encrypted using AES-256 encryption. Access to the database and cloud storage will be restricted to authorized personnel only. Regular backups will be performed to prevent data loss.

## 15. Integration Design

*   **15.1 External Interfaces:** The chatbot will integrate with external services for email verification (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) and potentially for future integration with mental health APIs for resource recommendations.
*   **15.2 API Specifications:** The chatbot will expose a RESTful API for communication between the frontend and backend. API endpoints will be secured using JWT authentication.
*   **15.3 Data Mapping:** Data mapping will be defined for each integration to ensure seamless data exchange between the chatbot and external systems.
