# Project Design Document: Mental Health Support Chatbot

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Status:** Final

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for a mental health support chatbot aimed at young adults (18-30) dealing with anxiety and stress. The chatbot will provide 24/7 support and resources. This document incorporates feedback from the Final Reviewer and builds upon the User Story, System Design Document (SDD), and UX considerations.

**User Story:** As a young adult user, I want to be able to create a secure account, log in, and manage my password, so that I can access personalized mental health support and resources while ensuring my data is protected.

## 2. Goals

*   Provide accessible and immediate mental health support to young adults.
*   Ensure user data privacy and security.
*   Offer personalized support based on user needs.
*   Comply with relevant data protection regulations.

## 3. Functional Requirements

*   **Account Creation:** Users can create accounts with a valid email address and a strong password. **Email verification is mandatory.**
*   **Login:** Users can log in securely with their credentials.
*   **Password Management:** Users can reset their passwords via email verification.
*   **Chat Interface:** Users can interact with the chatbot through a conversational interface.

## 7. User Flows

### 7.1 Account Creation

1.  User navigates to the registration page.
2.  User enters their email address and password.
3.  System validates the email format and **password strength (see section 8)**.
4.  System creates a new user account.
5.  System sends a verification email to the user's email address.
6.  User clicks the verification link in the email.
7.  System verifies the user's email address and activates the account.
8.  User is redirected to the login page.

**Error Handling:**

*   **Email address already registered:** Display an error message prompting the user to log in or reset their password.
*   **Invalid email format:** Display an error message prompting the user to enter a valid email address.
*   **Weak password:** Display an error message prompting the user to enter a stronger password, along with a password strength meter.
*   **Verification link expired:** Display an error message prompting the user to request a new verification email.

### 7.2 Login

1.  User navigates to the login page.
2.  User enters their email address and password.
3.  System authenticates the user's credentials.
4.  System creates a new session for the user.
5.  User is redirected to the chatbot interface.

**Error Handling:**

*   **Invalid credentials:** Display an error message prompting the user to try again or reset their password.
*   **Account not verified:** Display an error message prompting the user to verify their email address.

### 7.3 Password Reset

1.  User navigates to the password reset page.
2.  User enters their email address.
3.  System validates the email format.
4.  System sends a password reset email to the user's email address.
5.  User clicks the password reset link in the email.
6.  User is redirected to a page where they can enter a new password.
7.  System validates the new password strength.
8.  User submits the new password.
9.  System updates the user's password.
10. User is redirected to the login page.

**Error Handling:**

*   **Invalid email format:** Display an error message prompting the user to enter a valid email address.
*   **Email address not found:** Display an error message indicating that the email address is not registered.
*   **Password reset token expired:** Display an error message prompting the user to request a new password reset email.
*   **Weak password:** Display an error message prompting the user to enter a stronger password.

### 7.4 Account Deletion

1.  User navigates to the account settings page.
2.  User clicks the "Delete Account" button.
3.  System prompts the user to confirm their decision.
4.  User confirms the account deletion.
5.  System initiates the account deletion process, which includes:
    *   **Data anonymization or deletion:**  User data will be anonymized or deleted according to the **Data Retention Policy (see section 13)** and relevant regulations (GDPR, CCPA).
    *   **Session invalidation:** All active sessions for the user will be invalidated.
6.  System displays a confirmation message to the user.

**Error Handling:**

*   **Unexpected error during deletion:** Display an error message and prompt the user to try again later.

## 8. Password Strength Requirements

Passwords must meet the following requirements:

*   Minimum length: 12 characters
*   Must contain at least one uppercase letter
*   Must contain at least one lowercase letter
*   Must contain at least one number
*   Must contain at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*)

A password strength meter will be implemented to provide users with real-time feedback on the strength of their password.

## 9. Security Best Practices

The application will adhere to OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) guidelines to ensure security. This includes:

*   **Input validation:** All user input will be validated to prevent injection attacks.
*   **Output encoding:** All output will be encoded to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **Authentication and authorization:** Strong authentication and authorization mechanisms will be implemented to protect user data.
*   **Regular security audits:** Regular security audits will be conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Encryption:** Sensitive data will be encrypted both in transit and at rest.  HTTPS will be enforced for all communication.

## 10. Session Management

Session management will be implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

*   **Session duration:** Sessions will expire after 30 minutes of inactivity.
*   **Session invalidation:** Sessions can be invalidated by the user (e.g., by logging out) or by the system (e.g., due to inactivity or security reasons).
*   **Storage:** JWTs will be stored in HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks.

## 11. Data Retention Policy

User data will be retained for as long as the user has an active account. Upon account deletion, user data will be anonymized or deleted within 30 days, in accordance with GDPR and CCPA regulations.  Certain data, such as aggregated and anonymized usage statistics, may be retained for longer periods for analytical purposes.

## 12. Compliance

The application will comply with the following regulations:

*   **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):**  The application will comply with GDPR requirements for data privacy and security, including obtaining user consent for data collection, providing users with access to their data, and allowing users to delete their data.
*   **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act):** The application will comply with CCPA requirements for data privacy and security for California residents, including providing users with the right to know what personal information is collected about them, the right to delete their personal information, and the right to opt-out of the sale of their personal information.
*   **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act):** While the chatbot is not intended to provide medical advice or treatment, we will implement safeguards to protect the privacy and security of any health-related information that users may share.

## 13. Monitoring and Logging

Comprehensive monitoring and logging mechanisms will be implemented to track user activity and identify potential security issues.

*   **User activity logging:** All user activity, including logins, logouts, password resets, and chatbot interactions, will be logged.
*   **Error logging:** All errors will be logged, including the error message, timestamp, and user ID (if available).
*   **Security event logging:** Security events, such as failed login attempts and suspicious activity, will be logged.
*   **Monitoring dashboards:** Monitoring dashboards will be created to visualize key metrics, such as user activity, error rates, and security events.
*   **Alerting:** Alerts will be configured to notify administrators of critical events, such as security breaches and system outages.
*   **Log Retention:** Logs will be retained for a period of 12 months.
